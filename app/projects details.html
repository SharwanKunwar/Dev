    Welcome to my digital cave of creativity and caffeine-fueled code.

  <p className="text-gray-500">
    I'm Sharwan Jung Kunwar â€” a full-stack developer who believes clean code and clean UIs both
    deserve equal respect (and dark mode). I build web and mobile apps that not only *work*, but
    also *make sense* â€” because users deserve more than just "Hello World".

            My toolkit? Java, Spring Boot, React, PostgreSQL, Tailwind â€” and a dash of late-night debugging
            wizardry. I love solving real-world problems with tech, and occasionally, solving my own
            existential crises with console logs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-500">
            When I'm not coding, I'm either strumming my guitar like it's my second keyboard, or learning
            boxing â€” because nothing says "I can handle tough bugs" like dodging punches.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-500">
            I'm not just here to build things; I'm here to build things that matter â€” with people who care
            about quality, creativity, and pushing the limits (without breaking production... too often).
